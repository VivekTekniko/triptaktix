Free accommodation is also provided by some registered trusts in the form of sarais for the poor. The number of pilgrims who visit the shrine every year has increased from 1.4 million in 1986 to 8.2 million in 2009. A bazaar sells souvenirs, dry fruit, woolen garments, hosiery, and leather jackets. To reach Vaishno Devi, pilgrims register at Katra before starting the trek, and by registering, the pilgrims get accident insurance up to 100,000 INR while on the trek of 14 km. There is another trek of 2.5 km from Vaishno Devi temple to Baba Bhaironnath. Electric vehicles and helicopter services are available for pilgrims. A new ropeway system has just been inaugurated from the Vaishno Devi Bhawan to the Bhairon Baba Mandir, reducing the journey to time to just 3 minutes. The ropeway can carry 800 people every hour.",
